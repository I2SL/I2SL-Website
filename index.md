# Optics and Algorithms

Welcome to our lab page!

We are a computational imaging lab in the [Wyant College of Optical Sciences](https://www.optics.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. We develop new imaging modalities that perform optimally with respect to task-specific information measures. Our current research efforts include x-ray imaging for materials classification, event-based imaging, and quantum-limited superresolution imaging.

# Highlights


### Our Research

Our research involves the joint design of optics and algorithms allowing us to process signals in the optical and electrical domain.
Across our projects we take an information theoretic approach to our system design.
