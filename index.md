# Optics and Algorithms

Welcome to our lab page!

We are a computational imaging lab in the [Wyant College of Optical Sciences](https://www.optics.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. We develop new imaging modalities that perform optimally with respect to task-specific information measures. Our current research efforts include x-ray imaging for materials classification, event-based imaging, and quantum-limited superresolution imaging.
