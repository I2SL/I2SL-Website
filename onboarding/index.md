# <i class="fas fa-stairs"></i>Onboarding

This page aims to explain some of the standards and conventions we wish to
uphold in our lab. It describes documentation standards, centralized workflow practices,
and internal operations. There is inevitably a learning curve associated with the tools
our lab uses in an effort to organize our efforts and uphold the principles of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
