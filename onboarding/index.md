# <i class="fas fa-stairs"></i>Onboarding

Our research ethos stems from our documentation standards (for code and data), our workflows, and our commitment to ethical science. This page aims to introduce some of the standards and conventions used in our lab which we have designed to organize our projects, facilitate communication, and uphold the principles of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).  

There is inevitably a learning curve associated with the practices employed in our lab. However, in the long-run the intent is to provide our members with a robust toolkit for conducting quality science.
