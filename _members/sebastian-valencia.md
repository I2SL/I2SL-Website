**Interests:** Optical Design, Display Optics, Metrology

I completed my B.S. degree in Optical Sciences & Engineering from the University of Arizona in 2022. I've previously worked as an optical engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and at Ball Aerospace. As an undergrad, my work focused on using Fourier Optics to improve Event-Based Sensor (EBS) technology for detection and tracking application viability. My current focus is on Reconfigurable Mode Sorters for Super-Resolution Imaging.
