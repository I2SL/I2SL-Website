**Interests:** Polarimetry, Optical Engineering

I am a dedicated undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Optical Sciences and Engineering at the University of Arizona, with an expected graduation date in May 2024. My passion for optics and engineering has driven me to engage in meaningful research experiences, including projects in polarimetry and hardware design during my time at the University of Arizona. In the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of interning at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, where I delved into hardware analysis for instruments deployed in a field campaign in Barbados. During the final quarter of my internship, I had the unique opportunity to join the team in Barbados, contributing to research efforts focused on studying the marine boundary layer. My journey in the world of optical sciences and engineering continues as I embark on a Master's program in the same field, driven by my unwavering commitment to advancing our understanding of the intricacies of optics and its applications.
