**Interests:** Computational Imaging, Applied Mathematics

 I am an eager-to-learn undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Optical Sciences & Engineering as well as Applied Mathematics. My interest in the study of light supplemented by a passion for deep mathematics drew me to the field of computational imaging, a discipline of study that the Intelligent Imaging and Sensing Lab is very familiar with. I am excited to work on research projects in this context, as I believe a day is never wasted as long as you learn something.
