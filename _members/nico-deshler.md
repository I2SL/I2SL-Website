**Interest:** Computational Imaging, Quantum Information Theory, Compressive Sensing

I graduated from the University of California Berkeley in 2021 with degrees in physics and computer science. My interest in computational imaging began while working on a lensless computational camera called DiffuserCam as an undergraduate researcher in the Waller Lab.
I spent the last two years of my undergraduate experience working part-time at Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center where I supported the development of an interferometric computational camera called SPIDER which sought to collapse bulky space-based telescopes onto printable photonic integrated circuits. Upon joining the Intelligent Imaging and Design Lab in 2022, I have been exploring imaging modalities predicated on a quantum description of light. My PhD research seeks to create quantum super-resolution imaging systems that leverage ideas from compressive sensing and adaptive Bayesian estimation.
