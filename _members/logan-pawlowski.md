**Interests:** Laser Diode & Fiber Technologies, Detection/Tracking, Low-light Imaging

I was born and raised in Corvallis, Oregon, where I worked as a mechanic, bodyworker, and painter for a professional hot rod restoration shop, while also working as a KTM/Husqvarna motorcycle mechanic. My hobbies of film and photography sparked an interest in optical sciences and engineering that brought me to the University of Arizona. Since then, I have interned at Northrop Grumman Space Systems and Leonardo Electronics, where I have focused on detection/tracking technologies, directed energy and beam control subsystems, 3D-modeling, optical metrology, and laser diode manufacturing processes. My current research supports the development of an intelligent event-based sensor (EBS) motion algorithm through outdoor data collection efforts using fixed-wing aircraft and quadcopters as airborne targets to improve EBS task-based performance limitations. Aside from academia, you will find me outdoors doing anything from snow-skiing, surfing, biking, or climbing mountains.
