I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and completed graduate course work towards my Master of Public Administration degree at Long Island University in Brookville, New York as well as Northern Arizona University. I have worked in the private sector, local government, nonprofit industry, and academia. I have worked as a program manager, grant writer, assistant director of financial aid, assistant director of grants, and deputy director of grants management to name only a few. I have also assisted with a gubernatorial campaign; have a successful floral design, gift basket, and event coordinating business; have a book club; and regularly volunteer in the audio visual ministry at my church. I love period pieces, documentaries, a good book, cooking, spending time with my family and friends, and laughter â€“ lots of laughter.
