**Interests:** Information Theory, Quantum Information Theory, Statistical Imaging

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree and Master of Philosophy in Physics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, focused on the theoretical study of TE-TM splitting in quantum cavities and the topological properties of optical. I began my Ph.D. in Optical Science at The University of Arizona in 2018, working with Professor Amit Ashok on the topics of application of information theory in imaging and quantum sensing. After graduating in 2022, I started working as an algorithm engineer in KLA.
