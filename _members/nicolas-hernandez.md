**Interest:**Â Wavefront sensing, Deep Learning, Fourier Optics

I graduated from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso in electronics engineering. My interests are based in wavefront sensing, deep learning applied to wavefront sensors, and Fourier optics. Over the last two years I have been  enhancing the dynamical response of the Pyramid wavefront sensor, developing new concepts in holographic wavefront sensors, and building neural networks reconstruction algorithms. The latter was experimentally confirmed in the Observatorie de Haute-Provence, France. Currently, I'm doing my PhD in the University of Arizona where I hope to learn new ideas, and do research beyond my current sphere of knowledge.
