**Interests:** Image processing, statistical optics, system programming

 I am a second-year master's student working within the event-based imaging subgroup at I2SL. My current project is prototyping a fused tracking system that combines the temporal advantages of event-based sensors with the classification advantages of traditional cameras. I earned my bachelor's degree in Physics from Reed College, where my undergraduate thesis examined the propagation of ionizing radiation through the interstellar medium. After my bachelor's, I worked as an analyst programmer at Portland State University. There, I developed deconvolution routines for digital holographic microscopy. This experience fostered my interest in imaging, which led me to the optics program here at the University of Arizona. Since joining UA, I've worked for the Environmental Protection Agency to aid in tracking surface-level concentrations of fine particulate matter using satellite measurements of optical depth and geochemical models.
